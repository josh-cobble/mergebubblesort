# mergebubblesort

Welcome to the Bubble-Merge-Sort Machine!

Enter an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive). Once you do so, an array will be randomly generated using the integer you entered as the number of elements in the array. For Example, entering '9' (without the quotation marks) generates an array of 9 random numbers.

These numbers will then be sorted from smallest to largest using Bubblesort and Mergesort. The time it took each array to be sorted will appear below each array in nanoseconds. Note that your unsorted array will be stored to the 'storearray.txt' file and the sorted one will be stored to 'sortarray.txt'.

Enter '-1' to exit the program.
